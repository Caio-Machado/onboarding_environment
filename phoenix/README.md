## Routes

- **/products**  | GET |
> The **/products** route returns a json with all the products registered in the database. If the database is empty it will return an empty json. It's possible to use parameters in the url for filtering the result, os the parameters correspond to the product information.

#### **The parameters:**
- **name, sku, description**
> All this three paramters have the same structure, both use some word to search for products that have this word in some part of their composition.

- **amount**
> This paramter needs a integer value. If used without the paramter c_amount, he will return the products has the same value.

- **price**
> This paramter needs a integer or float value. If used without the paramter c_price, he will return the products has the same value.

- **c_amount, c_price**
> This two paramters has the same structure, both use the "gt" and "lt" with values were "gt" its equals to greater than and "lt" its less than. In other words "gt" its for values greater than the base value, and the "lt" its for values lower than the base value. the c_amount is used with the paramter amount and the c_price with the paramter price.

**Note**
> If the paramters is not accompanied by your paramter relativo (price or amount), the filter will understand this as a invÃ¡lid paramter.

Examples.
```
# parameters of a filter for products that have in their name the word coffee and a value less than 10.
/products?name=coffe&amount=10&c_amount=lt
```
